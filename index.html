            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Callum—a passionate motorsport enthusiast and a dedicated mechanical engineering major. My journey into racing began with karting, where I developed a deep appreciation for the technical and strategic aspects of the sport. Over time, my passion expanded into sim racing and engineering, allowing me to combine my love for driving with my technical expertise.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Through my engineering studies, I've gained valuable knowledge that has helped me refine my racing simulator, 
                making it as close to real life as possible. From developing custom setups to fine-tuning physics for enhanced realism, I am constantly 
                working to bridge the gap between virtual and real-world racing. 
                Currently, I am developing and enhancing a 4080 aluminum profile sim rig, optimizing 
                its structure for maximum stability and immersion. This project allows me to apply 
                my engineering expertise to create a simulator that not only improves my own 
                training but also serves as a platform for 
                advancing sim racing technology.

                <h3>What I Race In</h3>
                <p>I race in multiple disciplines: F1 esports, go-karting, and sim racing. My focus is on pushing myself to the limit across different racing formats, constantly adapting my driving style and strategy to suit each one. 
                    The thrill of competition is what drives me, and each 
                    race presents a unique challenge, whether it's battling for t
                    he top spot in esports, navigating the tight corners in karting, or mastering the technical aspects of sim racing. Every victory is a testament to the hard work and dedication I put into improving my skills across these disciplines.</p>

                <h3>Racing Achievements</h3>
                <p>I have secured over 10 victories in F4 on iRacing, along with 3 wins in the F1600 series and 2 in Formula Vee. Each of these accomplishments represents a significant milestone in my journey as a driver, pushing me to refine my skills and continuously improve. Competing in different cars across a variety of tracks has given me invaluable experience, each race presenting its own unique set of challenges—whether it's mastering technical corners, perfecting racecraft in close 
                    battles, or adapting to varying track conditions.
                    Among my most memorable achievements is my first-ever F1600 victory at Summit Point Raceway. That race was a defining moment in my career, reinforcing my passion for racing and my commitment to honing my craft. The intense competition, the 
                    strategic overtakes, and the final push to cross the finish line in first place made it an unforgettable experience. It solidified my dedication to sim racing, proving that persistence and continuous learning are key to success in this sport.

                <h3>Karting</h3>
                <p>I primarily raced in a ROK kart, spending countless laps 
                    around KF1 Karting Circuit in the Kranji area, pushing 
                    both myself and the machine to the limit. Mastering the 
                    track required precision—figuring out the optimal racing line, 
                    hitting every apex, and finding the right balance between aggression and control. I dedicated hours to refining my skills, learning how to adapt to different conditions and improve my lap times with every session.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Beyond competitive karting, I also participated in numerous rental-kart races at KF1, 
                    further sharpening my racecraft and gaining 
                    valuable on-track experience. While I eventually 
                    had to step away from race karts due to the high costs 
                    and the general lack of support for karting development, I 
                    still take part in rental kart races from time to time to stay connected to the sport and continue honing my driving skills. The lessons I’ve learned—both technical and strategic—remain invaluable, shaping my approach to racing, whether in real life or in simulation.
                    And with that, I now spend most time on developing my simulator, racing in LFM (LowFuelMotorsport)
                    and iRacing endurance races, like the 12h Bathurst, 24h Spa, etc.
